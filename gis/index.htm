      <h2>GIS Projects</h2>

      <p><em>IH-94 Corridor Study, Wisconsin Department of Transportation:</em> As part of a larger corridor study, Mr. Wilcomb contributed his expertise to the production of a new enterprise GIS database, based on SQL Server and ArcSDE technology. At the center of the new enterprise GIS database is a new linear referencing system (LRS) for the corridor to which all other layers can be tied, as well as a translation mechanism from the legacy Location Control Management (LCM) system based on links and offsets to the new LRS. Mr. Wilcomb supervised the data production and provided calibration and quality control to this process. Additionally, he created a geoprocessing model and python script to automate the process of assigning crash data to different categories based on linear referencing, dynamic segmentation and spatial joins. Client: Wisconsin DOT; 2009-2011</p>

      <p><em>On-Site GIS Services, New York Metropolitan Transportation Council:</em> Mr. Wilcomb has spent several years working on-site at the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council (NYMTC), the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the New York City area. At NYMTC, Mr. Wilcomb provides a full range of GIS capabilities to the organization, including map production, spatial data analysis and data production, as well as periodic GIS training courses and technical support for NYMTC staff. Additionally, Mr. Wilcomb implemented ArcGIS Server for NYMTC and provided custom web mapping application development using the JavaScript and Google Maps APIs for ArcGIS Server as well as data replication services. While serving at NYMTC, Mr. Wilcomb has worked with both internal staff and outside consultants to provide the client with expertise and technical knowledge to keep their organization at the forefront of spatial data technologies. Client: New York Metropolitan Transportation Council; 2007 - 2010</p> 

      <p><em>Enterprise-Class Geospatial Database Development (EGIS) Project, North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority:</em> Mr. Wilcomb served as the technical lead for implementation of the ArcGIS Server and ArcSDE/SQL Server solution on the client’s application/web server and developed several map services for the client. Mr. Wilcomb also led the implementation of the NJTPA Geoportal, a web browser based system for searching metadata which serves as the public face of the Enterprise-Class GIS/T Implementation project. Additionally, Mr. Wilcomb met with the client and project stakeholders to map out client and user needs for the Enterprise-Class GIS/T Implementation and developed data download and replication strategies to facilitate data sharing. Client: North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority; 2008-2010</p>

      <p><em>Comprehensive Street Management Plan, New York City Department of Transportation:</em> Mr. Wilcomb analyzed and diagrammed current practices and workflows in the discovery phase of this New York City Department of Transportation multi-year effort, which developed a strategy for coordinating street work among public agencies, utility companies, property owners/developers, and contractors within the City’s Right-of-Way.  Some of the elements used to build the program included the development of an asset management strategy, a short and long term infrastructure management program, a pavement management plan, and a refined Capital Program Process.  The project included an evaluation/incorporation of world-wide best practices and a technology strategy.  Client: NYC Economic Development Corporation/NYC Department of Transportation, 2007-2010</p>

      <p><em>Travel Demand Management (TDM) Program, New Jersey Department of Transportation:</em> Using spatial analysis techniques and a custom GIS application, potential Park & Ride locations were selected, evaluated and scored based on proximity to NJ Transit station locations and direction of travel. Client: New Jersey DOT; 2009-2010</p>

      <p><em>Regional Safety Priorities Update Study, North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority:</em> Using enterprise database and geospatial technology, Mr. Wilcomb contributed to the NJTPA Regional Safety Priorities Update Study by selecting the highest risk areas based on linear referencing and dynamic segmentation. The NJDOT road network was overlaid with crash locations and an algorithm for weighting crash data based on several variables was used to rank the areas that had the highest safety risk.  Additionally, Mr. Wilcomb created the report appendices with high crash location maps and detailed crash data tables. Client: North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority; 2008</p>

      <p><em>National Flood Map Modernization Program, Federal Emergency Management Agency:</em> As a member of the Map Modernization team in the Regional Mapping Center (RMC) for FEMA Region II, Mr. Wilcomb worked to produce and manage the update of Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps (DFIRMs) and Geodatabases. As part of the RMC, he coordinated between FEMA and project stakeholders to arrange data sharing and collection. Mr. Wilcomb managed the processing of LiDAR and contour elevation data for use in new flood hazard delineations and updated flood hazard studies with new flood profiles and cross sections. Mr. Wilcomb managed and trained staff to deliver several FEMA task orders involving various aspects of the map and Geodatabase production process. He also developed a thorough QA/ QC strategy for reviewing preliminary flood maps and Geodatabases submitted by mapping partners to the RMC. Mr. Wilcomb earned the Certified Floodplain Manager (CFM) certification from the Association of State Flood Plain Managers in 2006. Client: Federal Emergency Management Agency; 2005-2007</p> 

      <p><em>161st Street/River Avenue Rezoning Environmental Assessment Statement:</em> Mr. Wilcomb contributed to the 161st Street/River Ave Rezoning EAS by conducting data analysis on Census Tract housing data and compiling these data to deliver the Housing Profile summary of the Preliminary Assessment. Client: NYC Department of City Planning; 2008</p>

      <p><em>Lower Concourse Rezoning and Related Actions Environmental Impact Statement:</em> Mr. Wilcomb provided GIS analysis and map production for the Lower Concourse Rezoning and Related Actions EIS project. Client: NYC Department of City Planning; 2007</p>
